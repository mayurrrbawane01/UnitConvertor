In physics and chemistry, **Mass**, **Volume**, and **Length** are the three fundamental "building blocks" of measurement. Together, they allow us to describe the physical size and quantity of everything in the universe.

## 1. Length (The Distance)

Length is the measurement of something from end to end. It is a **one-dimensional** measure.

* **Standard Unit (SI):** Meter (m).
* **Tools:** Ruler, measuring tape, or vernier calipers.
* **Concepts:** * **Distance:** The total path traveled.
* **Displacement:** The straight-line distance between the start and end points.


* **Fun Fact:** Light travels approximately 300,000 kilometers in just one second!

## 2. Volume (The Space)

Volume is the amount of **three-dimensional space** an object occupies. Whether it is a gas in a balloon or water in a glass, volume tells you how much "room" it takes up.

* **Standard Unit (SI):** Cubic meter (), though we commonly use Liters (L) or milliliters (mL).
* **Calculation:**
* For a regular box: .
* For irregular objects: We use **Water Displacement** (dropping the object in water and seeing how much the water level rises).


* **Important Note:** Gases have "variable volume," meaning they expand or compress to fit their container.

## 3. Mass (The Matter)

Mass is the measure of the **amount of matter** in an object. It is often confused with weight, but they are very different.

* **Standard Unit (SI):** Kilogram (kg).
* **Key Rule:** Mass is constant. Your mass is the same on Earth as it is on the Moon because the "stuff" you are made of doesn't change.
* **Mass vs. Weight:**
* **Mass:** How much matter is there (measured in kg).
* **Weight:** The force of gravity pulling on that mass (measured in Newtons). On the Moon, you weigh less, but your mass is identical.

### How They Relate: Density

If you combine these three, you get **Density**, which tells you how tightly "packed" an object is.

The formula for density is:



*(Where  is density,  is mass, and  is volume)*

| Property | Dimension | Measures... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Length** | 1D | Distance between two points. |
| **Volume** | 3D | Space occupied by an object. |
| **Mass** | N/A | Total matter inside an object. |
